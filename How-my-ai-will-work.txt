I say a phrase and then my ai will seperate my sentence into words, and then those words 
will run through a keyword table to filter out all the executable keywords. 
The extra keywords will be name variables (like name a file "test23"), "test23"
is the name variable. The executable keywords will run through the exec
table and then find the command that has the most matched keywords. 
My ai will ask if I want to run this command and use my name variable in it.
For example I say "Make a folder on the desktop and name it 'yellow'"

1. I first will find the 'and' and seperate the sentence into 
   two sentences
2. Those two sentences will be executed individually
3. I will then seperate the sentence into words and run the words in my
executable words table. 
4. All the extra keywords like "yellow" and "desktop" will be used as named
variables to be used in an execution script
4. 90% match(highest match gets chosen): {
  keywords: [Make, folder, on] -- 85% "*make a *folder *on the desktop"
    script: """
      PYTHON MAKE FOLDER AND NAME IT
    """
   },
   {
     keywords: [make, folder] -- 80% match "*make a *folder on the desktop",
     script: """
      PYTHON MAKE FOLDER IN DEFAULT FOLDER
     """
   }
